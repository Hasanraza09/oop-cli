# TypeScript OOP Console App

## Description

This project is a TypeScript console application that demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## How It Was Made

The project was developed by watching an educational video on OOP in C# and then translating the concepts into TypeScript. It includes the use of getters, setters, and accessors for data control, showcasing a practical implementation of OOP principles in a console-based environment.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of OOP concepts and their application in TypeScript. I learned how to create classes, use access modifiers, implement getters/setters, and leverage inheritance and polymorphism to build structured and reusable code.
